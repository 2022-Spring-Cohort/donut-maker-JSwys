          <p>Fred Hatfield grew up poor, deep in the Appalachian Mountains. Originally a Moonshine maker, he spent his
            young life producing and distributing hooch to nearby families. He was well known on the mountain, and he
            was
            feared. His product however, had devastating effects on his community. Blood fueds were rampant, with heavy
            losses on all sides through generations, fueled by Fred's trade.
          </p>
          <p>Everything changed one fateful afternoon 1965. While distilling a new batch of his moonshine in a
            thunderstorm, Fred was struck by lightning. This was the fifth time it had happened, but on this occurence
            Fred had a revelation. He saw clearly the damage this trade was doing to his rural community. Fred vowed
            from
            that moment to never touch another drop of spirits and set about learning how to make donuts. Hence, Fred
            the
            Baker Baking Co. was born.</p>
